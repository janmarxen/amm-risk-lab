Priority:
- Paralellize LPDataset by sending data directly to GPU?
- Make pretraining, finetuning and testing scripts load best parameters from GS.
- Ameliorate outlier removal mechanism and see correctness of processed data.
- Make autoregressive testing part of the pipeline.
- Print out the cross-table after testing.
- Implement Regularization techniques
- Implement data augmentation techniques
- Change pre training validation to main pool?

- Backtest LP simulation against real-data
- Distribute LP strategy simulation with CUDA. 
- Make the simulations Gas fees aware.


Non-Priority:
- Create Reinforcement Learning Bot ()
