Piority:
- Save supervised problem with at least 20 lags. Make LPsDataset load how many lags it wants (instead of preprocessing it itself).
- Ensure that LP data is downloaded to scratch in the given supercomputer.
- Create option to predict volume instead.
- Create Transformer based prototype (Autoformer, TimeNet).

- Backtest LP simulation against real-data
- Distribute LP strategy simulation with CUDA. 
- Make the simulations Gas fees aware.


Non-Priority:
- Create Reinforcement Learning Bot ()
